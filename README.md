# practice_school_predictions
This is an extension of my MOD 5 project where I was trying to predict the school grades of NYC schools in the year 2006-2007.  
The first time around, after I had webscrapped each school's enrollment information, student-teacher ratio, percent of free-reduced lunch, and the district the school belonged to; I had to go through each district and manually match each school up because of the format of the webscrapped data and the dataset that I had gotten from NYC Open Data had been so drastically different.
This repo is dedicated to trying to make the process more efficient while still keeping the same amount of rows.
